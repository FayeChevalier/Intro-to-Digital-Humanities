COOL THINGS RE METHODOLOGY OF TREES:
(3)-follows + accounts for process(es) of rupture + de-centralizaiton of (structures of) knowledge + (systems of) values
-recognition tht texts do not opperate in a vacuum--challenges "representational individual" mode of organization (p 76)
(5)-potential to filter out "distracting" + obvious modes of organization (e.g. genre) in favor of more specialized modes (e.g. tense usage + word choice) (p 77)
-accounts for arbitrary nature of "innovative shifts" in stylistics etc (p 77)
(2)-tracks when and (potentially, depending on context etc) how influences enter + shift order
(1)-establishes standards/organizational modes for determining value/inter-relation (fig 33)

QUESTIONS RE LITERATURE RASIED BY #TREES:
-can lit or language be traced to a single source?
-survival of literacy?
-how "style" is created/comes to be ordered/known/valued?
-cultural pressures on con- and divergence, calcification by culture

QUESTIONS ETC RE FRANK's DANG METHODS:
-does not fully account for arbitrary nature of ~the center~ i.e. can potentially give illusion tht structural centers are forever-fixed points (e.g. elements listed on fig 30) (p 72)
-not critical enough of how "origins" of style etc. are "chosen"/ordered
-not enough attribution to social forces/conditions at play in organization of literary knowledge/history/theory i.e. does not account for effects of Culture Industry + white supremacy at work in determining literary value systems
-does interpretation still not exist after explanation? Couldn't explanation (as he defines it) be a part of interpretation?

QUESTIONABLE:
-critical enough of how "style" is created/comes to be ordered/known? 


Jagiela:
ANNOTATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS:
p. 70 "a tree is a way of sketching *how far* a certain language has moved from another one, or from their common point of origin. And if language evolves by diverging, why not literature too?"
  -can lit or language be traced to a single source? Is that the aim of the tree, or to illustrate movement in the opp. direction?
  -is this mere classification?
  -what is gained from being able to create and trace this branching?
p. 72 
  -survival of literacy, trees as means of determining what "stands the test of time" and illuminating what doesn't
p. 74, middle paragraph
  -Moretti recognize complications (privelege, status) of "weeding out" certain works, but doesn't really take that anywhere
  -possibly even dismisses it as unimportant/inconsequential
p. 76 "Devices and genres; not texts." to ". . .for literary history"
  -returns to idea of scale, issues with basic ideas of scale re:genre, texts, textual elements
p. 77 "totally *random* attempts at innovation. . ."
  -divergence leads to evolution, but can facilitate survival or extincition depending on success of attempts/methods
p. 77 "But instead of reiterating. . ."
  -trees revive lost texts, illustrate unique diversions/deviations from "canon"
p. 80
  -examines relationship b/n con- and di- vergence
P. 81 "cultural history is bound. . ."
  -cultural pressures on con- and divergence, calcification by culture
p. 82-7, look at "free indirect style"
  -what do these five pages do for our understanding of trees re: literary history? Did I miss something?
p. 91 "explanation over interpretation"
  -Moretti's argument in a nutshell
  -does interpretation still not exist after explanation? Couldn't explanation (as he defines it) be a part of interpretation? 
  -if purpose of trees ends at explanation, what is their larger purpose? How should they be integrated into studies of literature?
